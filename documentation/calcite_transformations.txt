AST-level transformations (SqlNode-level)
- simplifyDoubleNegation
- normalizeConjunctionOrder
- pushNotDown
- foldBooleanConstants

Planner (RelOptRule) transformations supported by applyRelTransformations
Projection rules:
- ProjectMergeRule
- ProjectRemoveRule
- ProjectJoinTransposeRule
- ProjectFilterTransposeRule
- ProjectSetOpTransposeRule
- ProjectTableScanRule (resolved reflectively; version-dependent)

Filter rules:
- FilterMergeRule
- FilterProjectTransposeRule
- FilterJoinRule (maps to FILTER_INTO_JOIN)
- FilterAggregateTransposeRule
- FilterWindowTransposeRule
- FilterTableScanRule (resolved reflectively; version-/adapter-dependent)

Join rules:
- JoinCommuteRule
- JoinAssociateRule
- JoinPushExpressionsRule
- JoinConditionPushRule
- SemiJoinRule (resolved reflectively; version-dependent)

Aggregate rules:
- AggregateProjectPullUpConstantsRule
- AggregateRemoveRule
- AggregateJoinTransposeRule
- AggregateUnionTransposeRule
- AggregateProjectMergeRule
- AggregateCaseToFilterRule

Sort & limit rules:
- SortRemoveRule
- SortUnionTransposeRule
- SortProjectTransposeRule
- SortJoinTransposeRule

Set operation rules:
- UnionMergeRule
- UnionPullUpConstantsRule
- IntersectToDistinctRule
- MinusToDistinctRule

Window rules:
- ProjectWindowTransposeRule
- FilterWindowTransposeRule

Other/general rules:
- ValuesReduceRule (resolved reflectively; version-dependent)
- ReduceExpressionsRule (resolved reflectively; adds common reduce-expr rules)
- PruneEmptyRules (collects available PRUNE_EMPTY* rules reflectively)

Adapter rule sets (optional; discovered reflectively if on classpath):
- EnumerableRules
- JdbcRules (or JDBCRules)

Notes:
- Some names are resolved reflectively to accommodate Calcite version differences. If a specific constant is unavailable, similar rule constants are searched by name.
- Adapter rules require the corresponding adapter classes on the classpath; otherwise they’re skipped with a log message.
